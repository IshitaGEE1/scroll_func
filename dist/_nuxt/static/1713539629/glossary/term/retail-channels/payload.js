P2C definition\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nIf you’re in the commerce world, you’ve likely heard of D2C and B2C already. But what is P2C? \n\nP2C stands for [product-to-consumer](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fp2c-product-to-consumer\u002F \"product-to-consumer\"). Product-to-consumer management is an approach that businesses use to manage how product data moves between suppliers and buyers. The key element that defines P2C is that it condenses commerce systems into a single management view. This provides businesses with full control over all of their [product data](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-data-syndication\u002F) as it’s routed through endless channels across the commerce ecosystem, such as online stores, marketplaces, and social media networks. \n\n*Note: The path that product data takes as it moves across the commerce ecosystem is called the [product information value chain](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-information-value-chain\u002F \"product information value chain\").*\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EAn example of what P2C management means in context\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nConsider you’re a shoe manufacturer who needs to bring a new sneaker to market. Somehow you have to get all of the sneaker’s data – size, price, color, texture, weight, images, etc. – listed across thousands of consumer touchpoints, such as online retail stores, marketplaces, social media channels, price comparison sites, and more. But the catch is that each channel has different requirements for how the data is presented. For instance, data standards on [Google Shopping](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fgoogle-shopping\u002F) are different from Amazon, Facebook, TikTok, and so on.

The term refers to the process of selling items directly on social media, with consumers discovering, researching, and buying products without ever leaving a social network. \n\n## What is social commerce?\nSince its inception in the middle of the 2000s, there have been various acknowledged definitions for the term “social commerce.” Steve Rubel from Edelman defines social commerce as “creating places where people can collaborate online, get advice from trusted individuals, find goods and services and then purchase them.” Forrester’s Jeremiah Owyang calls social commerce the “Fifth Era of Social Media,” noting that “brands will serve community interests and grow based on community advocacy as users continue to drive innovation in this direction.” You can find many more definitions for social commerce from thought leaders worldwide, demonstrating just how complex and nebulous this term is.\n\nA common denominator? Social commerce relies on users of social platforms and their intersocial dynamics to sell products and services. Organizations must adapt and integrate themselves into an evolving and dynamic ecosystem to compete for audiences and deliver excellent online shopping experiences.\n\n## What makes social commerce so important?\n\nThe modern landscape of the Internet enables products to go many different ways to reach buyers. Arguably, the most cost-effective process for a business is to let product travel from one consumer to another, or even from one very influential consumer – influencer\u002Fcreator – to a new audience. When done correctly, social commerce can generate incredible revenues while keeping marketing costs relatively low. It doesn’t stop there: Social commerce is a powerful tool for creating brand awareness and enabling efficient feedback loops because the consumers can communicate directly with a seller or brand. A business can also monitor the online discourse forming around a product or brand.\n\nIn social commerce, user-generated content is key to spreading product information to new audiences. Online shoppers share their purchases, ratings, and pick lists, enabling other users in their network to engage with a product organically and from a trusted source. The cascading effects of social commerce mean that a product can “go viral”, a brand can create organic communities, and an organization can maintain a lively and faithful audience that ideally nurtures and grows organically.It's crucial to note that harnessing the full potential of social commerce requires a well-crafted strategy, particularly in the context of the \"[Digital Shelf](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fdigital-shelf\u002F).\" \n\nThe caveat: Only a high-level social commerce strategy can leverage its potential, and new organizations see themselves confronted with an ever-growing complexity in the commerce space. The explosion of social commerce plays a major role in the phenomenon known as [Commerce Anarchy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fcommerce-anarchy\u002F). Businesses must implement plans to combat it.\n\n### The most important social commerce platforms\n\nThere are hundreds of social commerce platforms. However, it is relatively easy to define the “big 5” going by global user numbers:\n\n- Facebook: 2.9 billion users\n- Instagram: 2 billion users\n- TikTok: 1.05 billion users\n- Snapchat: 635 million users\n- Pinterest: 445 million users\n\nLines can get blurry when applying the “social commerce platform” label onto a social network. We could, for example, include YouTube. It would then be the second biggest after Facebook. The same is true for Reddit, Twitter, Quora, LinkedIn, Discord, and Twitch. All of these platforms have serious social commerce potential, but their design is not as obviously tailored toward product data. For example, you cannot sell a product on Reddit or Twitter directly on-platform but you can advertise it by creating supporting narratives.\n\nAnd this list is only centered around the US ecommerce ecosystem. While the Top5 are heavyweights worldwide, there are big players in other areas who cannot be ignored. For example, in Europe, the platforms Netlog and XING are serious competition to LinkedIn, while in Southeast Asia, hi5 is a games-focused social platform that rivals Facebook’s gaming features. \n\nUnderstanding the social commerce landscape and the ins and outs of every platform – the top 5 but also the ones orbiting them – is key to an effective social commerce strategy today.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"padding:20px;background:#d2f3fd;font-size:1.2rem;border-radius:5px;\"\u003E\n  \u003Ch4 style=\"font-size:1.7rem;font-weight: 600;\"\u003ESell more on TikTok with Advertising PX\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nYour customers are already browsing on TikTok, so why not enable them to buy directly on the fastest-growing channel?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n  \u003Ca data-v-ed7d5e72=\"\" data-v-633fc66a=\"\" data-v-2c2f2004=\"\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fadvertising-px\u002F\" class=\"u-navigation-button u-content-grid__action u-base-cta u-base-cta--primary\"\u003E\u003Csvg data-v-16a8718c=\"\" data-v-ed7d5e72=\"\" xmlns=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2000\u002Fsvg\" height=\"48\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\" width=\"48\"\u003E\u003Cpath data-v-16a8718c=\"\" d=\"m600-200-42-42 208-208H80v-60h686L558-718l42-42 280 280-280 280Z\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpath\u003E\u003C\u002Fsvg\u003E Learn more\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\n### Why do businesses need a social commerce strategy?\nSelling on social platforms is highly lucrative if executed well, requiring a high-level strategy. Doing it without a solid plan can damage a brand’s reputation. A business should be aware that selling on social commerce comes with many challenges. Success on a social platform usually follows a considerable period of trial and error.\n\nA solid social commerce strategy entails many individual strategies according to the respective target platforms and audiences. Market research is necessary to paint a complete picture: What are competitors already doing on these platforms? What does the target audience care about? How can a business integrate its products into the social experience? Who are the opinion leaders and influencers in a certain bubble, and how can a business utilize its potential? This only scratches the surface of social commerce’s complexity.\n\nOne key point is that social platform users do not primarily use these networks to purchase products. Strategies need to approach social commerce very differently from other channels – ad campaigns or e-mail. One such strategy native to social commerce platforms is influencer marketing.\n\nStill, if we consider social commerce as just another sales channel, it all starts with the product. A product is made up of digitally composed bits of information that give it content. This content needs to be put on social commerce platforms, but doing this correctly can be challenging - especially if a business wants to bring hundreds, thousands, millions of products and their variations to their consumers. In other words, a high-level social commerce strategy only works in conjunction with a matching technical setup.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow do you manage your product data on social commerce platforms?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nKeeping product information up-to-date across multiple social commerce platforms will play a major role in any successful strategy. Simply put, businesses must ensure their product data is exported tailor-made for the target platform’s requirements. Because there is no universal standard for product data, exporting the same data to different channels will lead to faulty, missing, or misplaced product data. This, in turn, will result in poor online shopping experiences, the loss of sales, fewer incentives for users to share a product, and on a higher level, the brand can be damaged, and brand awareness will suffer. \n\nTherefore, a successful social commerce strategy is grounded in a solid solution for this issue, ensuring that products automatically appear on all kinds of platforms as intended. Two commonly known solutions for this are feed management – with which a business perfectly manages their entire catalog’s product data in an efficient way – and product content syndication, an AI-supported process that adjusts product data according to the relevant social commerce platforms’ requirements.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EP2C unlocks social commerce’s potential\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nA complete solution for bringing products to audiences is a product-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fde\u002Fp2c-product-to-consumer\u002F \"P2C\")) platform that bypasses the pitfalls of commerce anarchy and takes reliable control of the so-called [product information value chains](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-information-value-chain\u002F \"product information value chains\") that denote the complete, tailor-made traversal of product data from a business to its buyers.\n\nOnce this is set up, a business can simply focus on actually selling their products on social commerce platforms – along with all social commerce strategies necessary to enable this – without having to worry about inaccurate product information management damaging their brand.\n\nFor more on social commerce, read our free [2023 social commerce guide](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fguides\u002Fthe-2023-social-commerce-guide\u002F).\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"padding:20px;background:#d2f3fd;font-size:1.2rem;border-radius:3px;\"\u003E\n  \u003Ch4 style=\"font-size:1.7rem;font-weight: 600;\"\u003EUnlock your full potential on TikTok with Advertising PX\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\n\u003Ca data-v-ed7d5e72=\"\" data-v-633fc66a=\"\" data-v-2c2f2004=\"\" href=\"\u002Fproducts\u002Fmarketplaces-px\u002F\" class=\"u-navigation-button u-content-grid__action u-base-cta u-base-cta--primary\"\u003E\u003Csvg data-v-16a8718c=\"\" data-v-ed7d5e72=\"\" xmlns=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.w3.org\u002F2000\u002Fsvg\" height=\"48\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\" width=\"48\"\u003E\u003Cpath data-v-16a8718c=\"\" d=\"m600-200-42-42 208-208H80v-60h686L558-718l42-42 280 280-280 280Z\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fpath\u003E\u003C\u002Fsvg\u003E Reach out to learn more\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EYou may also be interested in learning more about:\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E \n- [The rise of TikTok Shop: A game-changer for ecommerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002Fthe-rise-of-tiktok-shop-a-game-changer-for-ecommerce\u002F)\n- [The future of feed management](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2023-future-of-feed-management-trends\u002F)\n- [Productsup’s Social Commerce solutions](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fadvertising-px\u002F)",assignedCategory:w,relatedTerms:[W,J,ai,aU,dB,aC,P,aj],filterBar:m,title:"What is Social commerce?",urlSubfolder:l,slug:bC,openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_766iKqZh4zsaPOrbFYJxqT",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:40:22.594Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T12:53:57.364Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:"What is social commerce?",openGraphDescription:"What does social commerce mean, how do businesses start selling on platforms, and what is mandatory to know?

Instead of exporting the data channel by channel, product content syndication tools synchronize the process of onboarding product data to commerce platforms using automated technology. \n\nHowever, PCS goes beyond a simple export of data. PCS enables companies to first standardize, enrich, and tailor product data based on each channel’s requirements – before it all gets distributed. In doing so, companies can easily control how their product content appears in front of consumers, regardless of the location.  \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy are product content syndication services important?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nPeople don’t just run into a department store at the mall to buy products anymore. In fact, according to Google, 63% of shopping occasions start online. They visit several retail touchpoints before getting to the point of purchase.

It is time and resource exhaustive to onboard product data to multiple channels. Each channel has its own set of requirements for how product data needs to be presented, and new channels are popping up every day. Product content syndication services and platforms are necessary to successfully keep up with the pace of today’s commerce landscape. \n\nPCS empowers businesses to: \n\n- Speed up go-to-market by publishing and adjusting product information quickly\n- Expand to new markets by easily adding new channels across the globe\n- Strengthen brand equity and business relationships through consistent product storytelling\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWho uses product content syndication tools?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nProduct information management (PIM) executives, data managers, and other related titles from sales and marketing teams are typically responsible for acquiring and sourcing product information and using PCS tools to export product information across the commerce ecosystem.   \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat should you look for in product content syndication software?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nWhen looking at the PCS software market, businesses need to find the right partner that will help and work with them towards streamlining their commerce operations – not add complexity.

Through a whole range of features, Instagram Shopping allows businesses to link their shoppable products in Instagram Stories or in Feeds. Shoppers just tap on the product tags and be led to the brand’s website to view more information and purchase the product.\n\nWhen Instagram Checkout is rolled out outside the US market, Instagram Shopping will become a fully-fledged social commerce native.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E What are the best Instagram shopping features?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nWith much uncertainty about Meta’s commitment to the previously much-hyped Instagram Live Shopping – Live Shopping on Facebook is no more – Instagram will focus on creating shopping ecosystems for its popular Reels, Shops and Feed spaces. Here are the top Instagram Shopping features where you can best place your products and get the most from Instagram Shopping:\n\n \u003Ch3\u003EInstagram Shopping on Reels\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nSince 2020, Instagram has been slowly rolling out new ways for people to shop in its Reels feature. With Meta showing signs of losing confidence in Live Shopping outside of East Asia, Reels will become an area of focus for social giants. On Reels, you simply tag the shoppable products in Reels, and you can then find out more about them inline. Creators can also tag eligible products – once the creator and seller are approved for Shopping. Reels with product tags can be shown on your profile and in your feed, they cannot be Featured Reels. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EUsing feeds for Insta ads\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nInstagram feed posts were the first and still most important way for businesses with an Instagram Shopping setup to add Shopping tags to images or video posts. Shoppable feed posts can be effective pillars of your Instagram product-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\")) strategy because consumers are used to seeing these ads in their feeds.\n\nYou can also add up to 20 shopping tags to Insta’s Carousel ad feature. This is an easy way to showcase a new collection, item variants or a series of interconnected products.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EShops are your window display\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nYour Instagram Shop can be a gamechanger when it comes to finding new customers. As Instagram’s product discovery tool. Shops let you make a home for shoppable products, which users access from the View Shop button on their Instagram profile pages.\n\nThe Shop tab is an interesting way for users to find new brands and products as they use the tab to browse and explore actively.\n\nWhen they click on a product they see all the info they need to make their purchase.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EStories are still effective channels\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nFavored more by smaller brands, tagging products using product stickers on Instagram Stories is also an effective way to drive potential customers to your products. Using stickers makes this a more subtle approach to simply adding tags to Reels.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ELive Shopping on Instagram\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nInstagram Live promises to be one of the best ways to showcase products more authentically. Instagram Live Shopping means you can tag products directly in your Live broadcast for viewers to tap and then make a purchase.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EInstagram Shopping using Guides\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nInstagram Guides are a great way to share recommendations, themes, or tips. You can select guides that focus on places, products, or posts. Ring Fence some products or ideas that suit your audience’s needs, then create your Guide as a business or work with a creator\u002Finfluencer.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ELet the creators do your work\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nShopping with creators lets you leverage the power of influencers to promote your brand or products. Influencers and creators then drive sales on behalf of the brands they partner with. The creators\u002Finfluencers create shoppable Instagram posts and tag products from a brand.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow to set up Instagram Shopping\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nOnce you’ve been approved for Instagram Shopping, you can start getting your products out there in front of one of the world’s biggest and most active social commerce audiences. With Instagram Checkout set to roll out globally at some point (it’s currently only available in the US) there are boundless opportunities on the platform, especially with MIllennial, Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E1. Prove your eligibility\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nInstagram has strict requirements for setting up shopping. You first need to ensure that you are located in an approved market. Remember, your business should mostly sell physical goods and also fully comply with Instagram’s commerce Ts and Cs.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E2. Change your account to a business profile\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nBefore you can even think of setting up an Insta Shop, you need to convert your account to a business account. Once you do this, add all of your business details like contact information, company description and, most importantly, add a link to your website.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E3. Connect to Facebook\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nInstagram is part of Meta, and both Insta and Facebook share the same management suite. So you have to link your Instagram business profile with a Facebook Page. You can do this by clicking the Edit profile button in your business’s Instagram profile.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E4. Upload a product catalog\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nTo get your products into Instagram, you need to upload a product catalog or [product feed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed\u002F \"product feed\") which lists all of your inventory and the items’ attributes.\n\nYou can upload your catalog manually through the Catalog Manager, but there are a lot of requirements and specifications which means manually uploading catalogs is not recommended unless you are a micro-business with a small catalog.\n\nThe best way to upload a catalog is to use a product-to-consumer (P2C) management platform operated by a Meta partner. Productsup has the most comprehensive P2C management platform for [social commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"social commerce\").\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E5. Submit your account for approval\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nOnce you have gone through the above steps, submit your account to Instagram for approval. You can do this via the Settings tab in your account. Go to Shopping in your Settings to check up on your approval status, as this may take a few days.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E6. Turn on your shopping features\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nOnce approved, you can turn on all of the shopping features and start getting more products to more consumers. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou may also be interested in learning more about:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E \n- [Productsup's Feed Management solution](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Ffeed-management\u002F \"Feed Management\")\n- [All about the challenges of Commerce Anarchy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fcommerce-anarchy\u002F \"Commerce Anarchy\")\n- [The 2023 feed management guide](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fguides\u002Fthe-2023-feed-management-guide\u002F \"The 2023 feed management guide\")",assignedCategory:w,relatedTerms:[t,z,ax,ag,aT],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:bZ,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"instagram-shopping",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"zgMqYmVVYdH1uHx54c45Q",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:p,createdAt:"2022-09-07T08:56:17.900Z",updatedAt:"2022-09-12T08:20:49.118Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:"Glossary term page - Instagram shopping - Compose: SEO",title:dJ,description:dK}},openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_6spfwi0GDXAgFIT4IFLnKC",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:39:52.859Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T12:54:02.337Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:dJ,openGraphDescription:dK}}};O.metadata={tags:[]};O.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"3CVhc7v4hAvSTlYuYqTEHN",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:k}},revision:ad,createdAt:"2022-09-07T09:05:42.293Z",updatedAt:"2024-01-17T12:39:45.505Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};O.fields={name:"Glossary term page - Feed management - Glossary-Term-Page",headline:as,definition:"[Feed management](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Ffeed-management\u002F \"Feed management\") or product feed management is the process of sourcing, sorting, cleaning, and enriching product data to improve its appearance on marketing and selling channels. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EIn-depth definition of feed management\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nWhen you visit a retailer's website and click on a product, you’re probably used to seeing a product title, description, price, information about size, weight, color, and texture, images from multiple angles, videos, customer reviews, shipping options, and\u002For return policies.

This could range from a brand's website and social media profiles to third-party ecommerce platforms like [Amazon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Famazon-marketplace\u002F), eBay, and more. Just as in a physical store, the positioning, appearance, and overall presentation of products on the digital shelf greatly influence customer decisions.\n\nUnderstanding the digital shelf involves grasping how your products are presented, discovered, and ultimately purchased in the digital realm. Let's dive into the key elements that define this online ecosystem.\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EUnveiling product discovery in the online sphere\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\nProduct discovery in the digital landscape has evolved into a dynamic process that shapes consumer behaviors and purchasing decisions. Search engines like Google and Bing act as starting points, as consumers enter keywords to find desired products. Simultaneously, social media platforms serve as virtual marketplaces, influencing discovery through algorithms that recommend products based on user interests. Ecommerce giants, such as Amazon, offer extensive product options while utilizing personalized recommendations to engage users.\n\nInfluencer marketing further transforms the scene, where individuals' endorsements and reviews resonate with followers seeking authentic experiences. Targeted [digital advertising](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fadvertising-px\u002F) strategically positions products on websites and social media, complementing content marketing efforts like blogs and videos that inform and engage users. Word-of-mouth promotion has found digital expression through online reviews and social sharing, impacting product visibility.\n\nThe process of product discovery is an integral component of the digital shelf. To truly distinguish yourself on the digital shelf, it's imperative that your product pages are the ones customers encounter during searches—whether they're specifically seeking your products or generally exploring options.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe significance of digital shelf optimization\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nIn the expansive realm of ecommerce, digital shelf optimization holds a paramount role that transcends visibility. It is the meticulous craft of perfecting every facet of your online product presentation to create an immersive and impactful shopping journey for potential customers.\n\nAt its core, digital shelf optimization revolves around tailoring your product listings to captivate and convert. It encompasses a spectrum of elements, from the strategic integration of pertinent keywords in product titles and descriptions to the caliber of images that showcase your offerings. Each component harmoniously contributes to the seamless user experience that guides customers toward making purchasing decisions.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling outcome of digital shelf optimization is its potential to boost conversions. When potential buyers encounter products impeccably aligned with their requirements, meticulously showcased, and supported by favorable reviews, the path to purchase becomes irresistible. This synergy of elements elevates conversion rates, translating to tangible revenue growth for your ecommerce venture.\n\nBy dedicating efforts to refining your digital shelf, you not only differentiate yourself in a saturated market but also set the stage for enduring prosperity in the dynamic world of online business.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ECrafting a winning digital shelf strategy\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nA well-crafted digital shelf strategy is the compass that guides businesses towards success. This strategy involves a holistic approach to optimize the presentation, visibility, and appeal of products across various online platforms, such as online marketplaces. To effectively navigate this digital terrain and ensure a competitive edge, businesses must formulate a comprehensive and winning digital shelf strategy.\nDelving into the psyche of your target audience enables you to align your product offerings precisely with their desires, ensuring your digital shelf becomes a compelling destination. However, it's not just about what you offer; how you present it matters. Immersive visual elements, such as high-resolution images that offer intricate details and engaging videos that showcase product usage, create an experiential connection that bridges the gap between digital and physical shopping experiences.\n\nYet, success doesn't halt at visibility; it extends to credibility. Customer reviews and ratings establish trust, showcasing real experiences that help shoppers make confident decisions. Lastly, remaining adaptive is paramount. Regularly assess your strategy's performance, stay attuned to emerging trends, and adapt as needed. Crafting a winning digital shelf strategy demands a fusion of consumer insights, compelling presentation, search optimization finesse, and a commitment to staying agile in a swiftly evolving digital landscape.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe continuous evolution of digital shelf management\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nIn the dynamic realm of ecommerce, the art of managing the digital shelf has evolved into a multifaceted and strategic endeavor. No longer confined to a mere online presence, digital shelf management encompasses a holistic orchestration of product presentation, optimization, and engagement across a spectrum of online platforms. In this ever-shifting landscape, businesses are required to adopt a proactive and adaptable approach to maintain a competitive edge and sustained success in the digital domain.\n\nIn today's omnichannel landscape, the digital shelf extends beyond a single platform. Consumers interact with brands across various touchpoints – websites, social media, mobile apps, and more. Successful digital shelf management hinges on seamless integration across these channels, ensuring a consistent brand experience and messaging. This [omnichannel](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fomnichannel\u002F) approach not only amplifies visibility but also provides customers with a unified journey, irrespective of their chosen platform, reinforcing the importance of [Social Commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F) in today's digital ecosystem.\n\nYou may also be interested in learning more about: \n\n- [Maximize CPG sales + master the digital shelf with these product content experiments](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002Fmaximize-cpg-sales-digital-shelf\u002F)\n- [5 ways AI can enhance your ecommerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2023-how-ai-is-transforming-ecommerce\u002F)\n- [8 tips for turning commerce complexity into an advantage](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2023-eight-tips-for-business-growth\u002F)\n",assignedCategory:w,relatedTerms:[aQ,aR,C,ag],title:cC,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"digital-shelf"};S.metadata={tags:[]};S.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"3bnGD3kja0JIjq8xNI2Rbk",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:k}},revision:12,createdAt:"2022-09-08T13:27:25.278Z",updatedAt:"2024-01-17T13:09:37.187Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};S.fields={name:"Glossary term page - 3P marketplace - Glossary-Term-Page",header:q,headline:cx,definition:"A 3P sales model on marketplaces describes a retailer selling products on a marketplace as their own brand\u002Fstore.

The brand also maintains control over its pricing across a whole range of products rather than just several items.\n\nThese sellers can also ensure that their products are displayed correctly with the correct product descriptions.\n\nFor all the benefits of 3P selling, there are some disadvantages. Particularly when selling on Amazon, 3P sellers who don’t use a product-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\")) platform with a [marketplace solution](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Fmarketplace-experience\u002F \"marketplace solution\") have to manually create and optimize their listings and manage all their promotions.

But the seller is obliged to ensure that stock is available. This requires regular updates to your listings which may be difficult in the case the Amazon API won’t let you refresh your data at a given time.\n\nCompanies with large volumes of SKUs, even large marketing departments, struggle to maintain accurate product and order data. This is why a [smart marketplace solution](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fmarketplaces-px\u002F) is essential for managing product and order data before a single file with scheduled exports is sent to Amazon.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"padding:20px;background:#d2f3fd;font-size:1.2rem;border-radius:5px;\"\u003E\n  \u003Ch4 style=\"font-size:1.7rem;font-weight: 600;\"\u003EFuel your revenue on Amazon Marketplace with Productsup.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nMarketplaces PX enables you to easily import and enrich your product content.

You also lose control over pricing, which could damage your brand inf, for example, the [amazon marketplace](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Famazon-marketplace\u002F) decides to sell your items at a cut-price, thereby placing your products in a price category you may not want.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ECheck out the following resources for further learning:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n- [Productsup’s Feed Management solution](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Ffeed-management\u002F \"Productsup’s Feed Management solution\")\n- [The 2023 feed management guide](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fguides\u002Fthe-2023-feed-management-guide\u002F \"The 2023 feed management guide\")",assignedCategory:I,relatedTerms:[O,B,ay,C],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:cx,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"3p-marketplace",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"61x5VYVTc0jpzrK32DqGoY",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:p,createdAt:"2022-09-08T13:27:25.387Z",updatedAt:"2022-09-14T09:21:10.289Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:"Glossary term page - 3P marketplace - Compose: SEO",title:cy,description:cz}},openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_3bnGD3kja0JIjq8xNI2Rbk",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:39:29.535Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T12:54:07.620Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:cy,openGraphDescription:cz}}};W.metadata={tags:[]};W.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"5RUbhrdZKXpeFyXBb56mF7",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:k}},revision:L,createdAt:"2022-09-07T09:08:47.868Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T10:50:50.945Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};W.fields={name:"Glossary term page - 3D commerce - Glossary-Term-Page",header:q,headline:bY,definition:"3D commerce describes the multi-directional perspective companies use to approach their commerce operations, which provides instantaneous feedback loops, and ultimately, allows them to adapt to changing customer behavior.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EIn-depth definition of 3D commerce \u002F 3D ecommerce\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nCompanies leveraging 3D commerce have a holistic view of product data within the commerce ecosystem and can manage their [product information value chains (PIVCs)](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-information-value-chain\u002F \"PIVC\") from multiple angles. \n\nWhen PIVCs are managed using a 3D commerce approach, product data flows freely between suppliers and buyers.

In 2D commerce, product information only flows in one direction from suppliers to end users. This prevents companies from accessing critical information, like customer feedback or return data, in real-time. 2D commerce also limits the media channels companies can engage with their customers on. \n\nFor example, let’s say a customer wants to return a jacket they bought on Amazon. When they go to issue the return, they’re prompted to answer the reason for the return. They note that the jacket did not fit the description. If the brand selling the jacket uses a 2D commerce approach, it won’t receive that feedback data right away. But if the brand uses a 3D commerce approach, that feedback will be routed back to it instantaneouly. With 3D commerce, the brand can take immediate action to improve the jacket description on Amazon to avoid more returns down the line.  \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy is 3D commerce important?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nCompanies that leverage a 3D commerce as part of their overarching product-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\")) strategy benefit in the following ways: \n\n- Improve customer experiences through faster customer service and enriched product data\n- Lower costs by speeding up internal processes and maximizing resources\n- Expand reach by engaging with consumers on more channels\n- Take advantage of more commerce opportunities by gaining insights to customer preferences\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EMore information on 3D commerce:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E \n- [P2C: 2D commerce is obsolete, time to go 3D](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002Fp2c-2d-commerce-is-obsolete-time-to-go-3d\u002F \"P2C: 2D commerce is obsolete, time to go 3D\")\n- [Product management vs. product data management: what’s the difference?](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002Fproduct-management-platform\u002F \"Product management vs. product data management: what’s the difference?\")\n- [Transforming future relationships with the P2C Maturity Model](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2022-the-p2c-maturity-model\u002F \"Transforming future relationships with the P2C Maturity Model\")",assignedCategory:G,relatedTerms:[t,z,cM,aQ],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:bY,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"3d-commerce",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"1hehholUqdhEddHlAbOyr5",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:p,createdAt:"2022-09-07T09:08:47.858Z",updatedAt:"2022-09-12T08:22:10.922Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:"Glossary term page -

If you're curious about the words \"1P marketplace\" or want to know what Amazon 1P really means, this page is for you. This complete guide will make the terms easy to understand and will give you the knowledge to succeed on this exciting platform.\n\n## In-depth definition of 1p marketplace\n\nAt its core, the concept of a 1P Marketplace, or First Party Marketplace, describes the direct relationship between businesses and Amazon. In this setup, businesses become suppliers to Amazon. They sell their products to Amazon, which takes on the role of the seller responsible for listing, pricing, and fulfilling orders.\n\nThink of it like this: when you're part of a 1P Marketplace, you're handing over the sales and operational reins to Amazon. They become your virtual storefront, handling everything from showcasing your products to shipping them to customers.\n\nThis arrangement grants Amazon complete control over your product's journey within its vast online ecosystem. This not only means that Amazon can set prices and manage promotions, but it also places your products in a position to gain the coveted Prime eligibility, attracting the ever-growing community of loyal Prime members.\n\nIn contrast to the [3P Marketplace](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002F3p-marketplace\u002F), where sellers operate as independent entities, the 1P Marketplace is like having Amazon as your selling partner. It's a strategic move for businesses that leverage Amazon's unparalleled reach and resources to optimize their online sales strategy.\n\n## Benefits of Amazon 1P Marketplace\n\nSelling on Amazon 1P has benefits that can significantly impact your business's success.\n\n- __Prime Positioning and Customer Trust__\nOne of the most significant advantages of the 1P Marketplace is the potential to earn the coveted Prime badge for your products, whether through Amazon 1P, FBA, or [FBM](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Famazon-fbm\u002F). Prime members, known for their loyalty, enjoy fast and free shipping. By qualifying for Prime, your products gain enhanced visibility, credibility, and a competitive edge, leading to increased conversions and customer trust.\n\n- __Elevated Discoverability__\nLeveraging Amazon's robust search algorithm and vast customer base, the 1P Marketplace gives your products a better chance to surface prominently in search results. This heightened visibility can result in more clicks, views, and sales.\n\n- __Strategic Pricing Control__\nAmazon's extensive customer data and pricing tools enable you to fine-tune your pricing strategy. You can adjust prices based on market trends, competitor analysis, and demand fluctuations, ensuring your products remain competitive while maximizing profitability.\n\n- __Streamlined Fulfillment__\nAmazon's advanced warehousing and shipping infrastructure benefit businesses using Amazon 1P or [FBA](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Famazon-fba\u002F), providing quicker shipping times, reliable order processing, and reduced operational hassles. On the other hand, FBM allows you to maintain control over your fulfillment process.\n\n- __Customer Service and Returns__\nAmazon handles customer service and returns on your behalf, ensuring that any issues or inquiries are quickly addressed. This level of support enhances the overall shopping experience for customers and can help you maintain a positive brand image.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"padding:20px;background:#d2f3fd;font-size:1.2rem;border-radius:5px;\"\u003E\n  \u003Ch4 style=\"font-size:1.7rem;font-weight: 600;\"\u003EFuel your revenue on Amazon Marketplace with Productsup.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nMarketplaces PX enables you to easily import and enrich your product content.

This could lead to lower prices to stay competitive. This could impact your profit margins.\n\n- __Loss of Control over Branding__\nWhen listing products on Amazon 1P, you may have limited control over how your brand and products are presented. Amazon's algorithms might change your [product listings](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2023-optimize-amazon-product-listings\u002F) that don't align with your brand identity, potentially affecting how customers perceive your products.\n\n- __Limited Direct Customer Interaction__\nUsing Amazon 1P means Amazon handles customer interactions, including inquiries, returns, and feedback. This lack of direct communication with customers can make it challenging to build a loyal customer base and address their concerns or feedback in a personalized manner.\n\n- __Dependency on Amazon's Policies and Changes__\nAmazon frequently updates its policies and algorithms, sometimes leading to unforeseen shifts in your product's visibility and performance. These changes could impact your sales strategy and require constant adaptation to stay competitive.\n\n- __Risk of Competing with Amazon__\nAmazon has its own private-label products, and there's a risk that your products could directly compete with Amazon's offerings in the same category. This competition can potentially lead to decreased market share and sales for your brand.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy delving into the world of Amazon 1P Marketplace, you're taking a significant step toward expanding your brand's reach and increasing your sales potential. Embrace the benefits, strategies, and integration opportunities outlined in this guide to create a well-rounded and effective Amazon selling strategy. Remember, the power to succeed on Amazon's 1P Marketplace is yours. Start optimizing your approach today and unlock the full potential of this dynamic platform. Remember, the e-commerce landscape will continue to evolve.

You can control budgets, bids, and to set the location, ad schedule or to optimize the results from within the Google Merchant Center.\n\nGoogle Shopping is subsumed under the larger advertising medium called Google Surfaces which is immediately available to Google Shopping users. Google’s Surfaces lets your products appear in picture search results instead of the text search results. \n\nGoogle Surfaces also lists products as Local Inventory Ads (LIA), which means that [omnichannel](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fomnichannel\u002F \"omnichannel\") or hybrid businesses can also drive traffic to their physical store. This is attractive to consumers looking to buy in store and locally. To also have your Surface ads appearing in the LIA results, you will need to undergo an additional local inventory verification process.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy is managing a product feed important for Google shopping?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nIn addition to the marketing campaign, to list your products on Google Shopping, you will need to send a [product data feed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fgoogle-shopping-feed\u002F) to the Google Merchant Center. The feed contains all the necessary attributes or structured data for the items you are listing. Product ID, EAN, price, color, stock quantity, and ISBN are just some of the required attributes for your feed.\n\nConsumers locate and see your ads; then they click on the image or ad and “add them to their cart” – Google Shopping cart – and pay directly on Google. You set the campaigns, budget, targeting, etc., in your Merchant Center.\n\nBecause of the checkout function, Google charges a commission for processing orders that come via Google Surfaces and Gmost Google Shopping campaigns. It is essentially free to list your products once you have exported your feed via your product-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\")) platform’s [feed management](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Ffeed-management\u002F \"feed management\") solution.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat are Google shopping trends?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nGoogle shopping trends are determined by the search terms and search trends that potential customers are typing into Google. The search volume determines which product data is displayed. Google trends are influenced by a lot of factors but do not differ from general [social commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"social commerce\") trends. With free product listings on your shopping ads, selling on Google viral ad campaigns means there is no reason not to start selling your products on Google. \n\nSome of the top Google Shopping and Google Surfaces trends are fashion, video games, toys, and cosmetics. As with all other social commerce platforms, fashion is the clear leader.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat is the best way to sell on Google shopping?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nOne of the most important steps to creating successful Google Shopping campaigns is to have excellent product images. Make sure that the images on either your website or your [product feed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed\u002F \"product feed\") are top quality, consider using a P2C enriching software or management tool to ensure image quality across a large volume of SKUs.\n\nYour images should have clear, even lighting. A solid white, gray or light-colored background is best. You should clearly display the product being sold. It shouldn’t be too big or small. Always avoid pixelation, fading, or blurriness. \n\nUse your feed manager to ensure compliance with the required attributes ([product feed specifications](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed-specifications\u002F \"product feed specifications\")) for your campaigns. Google requires SKU number, title (enhance the titles with color, size, and style), description with information about the product, link to the listing page, image link, availability (in stock, out of stock), price (listed in the currency of the country where your product is sold), Google product category, and brand name. Your feed management software should have all of the required and recommended attributes that will combine to encourage Google to display your products.\n\nAlthough Google shopping ads are “free,” you should consider linking up your Shopping campaigns to your Google Ad campaigns. Link your Google Merchant account to your Google Ads account to ensure your ads are always up the top of the page.\n\nWondering how the [Google Shopping feed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fgoogle-shopping-feed\u002F) plays a role in your success?

This can include high-quality images, detailed product descriptions, comparison charts, and even videos. It provides a richer shopping experience for customers, ultimately boosting your product's visibility and conversion rates.\n\nA+ Content significantly improves the customer's understanding of a product, its features, and benefits, thereby increasing the likelihood of a purchase.

What sets it apart from standard product listings, and why should you make it an integral part of your e-commerce strategy? Let's explore the compelling reasons why utilizing A+ Content is a savvy move for any Amazon seller:\n\n- __1. Stand Out in a Crowded Marketplace__ :\nAmazon is home to millions of sellers offering a vast array of products. Amidst this extensive selection, it's crucial to make your listings shine. A+ Content allows you to stand out by offering a visually appealing and informative presentation that captures shoppers' attention as soon as they land on your product page. In a split second, you can make a lasting impression that sets your products apart from the competition.\n\n- __2. Boost Conversion Rates__ :\nUltimately, the goal of your Amazon listings is to convert visitors into buyers. A+ Content excels at this by providing a more engaging and persuasive shopping experience. When potential customers have access to comprehensive information and are visually engaged, they are more likely to make a purchase. Higher conversion rates mean more sales and revenue for your business.\n\n- __3. Tell Your Product's Story__ :\nEvery product has a story, and A+ Content gives you the space to tell it effectively. You can go beyond the standard bullet points and product specifications to convey the unique qualities, benefits, and value of your offerings. Use this storytelling opportunity to connect with your audience on a deeper level, addressing their needs and desires.\n\n- __4. Enhance Brand Credibility__ :\nBuilding trust in the e-commerce world is essential. A+ Content provides a platform for reinforcing your brand's credibility. By incorporating brand logos, colors, and messaging, you create a consistent brand presence that resonates with customers.

What began as a camera company – a tradition that’s still relevant for its tech developments – Snap has been wooing young social media users since 2011. Its co-founder, Evan Spiegel, remains CEO. Snapchat is both a social media platform and a developer and innovator of both cameras – which are placed in frames from glasses or sunglasses –  and AR lenses which are also placed in glasses.\n\nSnap has weathered a number of storms to maintain a very active user base who remain with the brand despite the almost monthly updates to its products and features. It’s original USP was that the images one sent – snaps – disappear or were inaccessible after a short period of time. This was intended to encourage more natural interaction.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow does Snapchat work?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nSnapchat started off with photo sharing, but it has followed the path of all other social media platforms and users now chat live on video,  send messages, and share stories and videos. Users can now save and store messages in private spaces.\n\nOne of Snapchat’s most innovative features has been its interface with filters and AR-based lenses, which it places in frames that the users wear. Snapchat was early to see the value in providing its users with instant reactions to messages and images via smartphones. Its AR developments changed the way users communicated online with instant messages that disappeared but also added fun filters and other VR additions.\n\nSnapchat radically alters its appearance and functionality regularly, more than any other social media platform. The only constant is that stories and chats remain the most important features. Instagram was inspired by Snapchat to have stories that only appeared for 24 hours, they launched the function around the time that Facebook was trying to acquire Snapchat in 2016.\n\nThe other element of Snapchat that keeps its Gen Z users happy is the company’s constant innovation in the area of augmented reality, where the platform remains a leader. Snapchat’s AR selfie filters first became famous with doggie ears and animated hats. Mid-2022, its 330 million daily users were having 6 million AR experiences every day.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EIs Snapchat good for marketing?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nBecause most of Snapchat's users are millennials and Gen-Zers, they have a younger demographic open to advertising on their terms and only for the items they need or want. Advertising has to look and ‘feel’ authentic to the users, or they will not trust the brand.\n\nMarketers can reach their target group on Snapchat in several main ways. Companies can create a Public Profile for their business and produce content and get reactions from followers and in feeds organically. Businesses can also create ads in a whole host of formats where products can be tagged. As with all other [social commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"Social Commerce\") platforms, Snapchat is actively working on monetizing the space and innovating ad formats to help brands leverage the platform for business.\n\nBusinesses can use the Dress up tab – similar to [Instagram’s Shopping tab](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Finstagram-shopping\u002F \"Instagram shopping\") – to market products. Users can click on Product stickers which act as product tags and then can see items they wish to purchase. Snapchat aims to create an AR-powered experience with the clothing items. Users click product stickers to reveal  brand sets where they can select specific products and then add stickers to their Snap frames.\n\nThe many other AR features, including geofilters and the Discover section, open up huge possibilities for marketers looking to place products, brands, or experiences in front of the user.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ESnapchat glossary\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Ch4\u003ESnap\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nUsers call all videos, images, and messages on Snapchat – “snaps”. A “snapback” is when a user responds to a snap.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EStory\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nYou can create stories by linking snaps and they then appear to your followers as a “story” or reel. They can tap through your story and get a feel for how your day went. These stories only stay visible for 24 hours. You can save your own stories before they disappear in the Memory section (private storage), where they remain visible to you forever.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003ESnapcode\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nA Snapcode is a scannable code that makes it easy to add new friends without them having to click a button in their accounts. Snapcodes are like QR codes and they can be located on the Profile screen. Access it by tapping the ghost icon or your Bitmoji in the corner of the Camera screen and let your new friend scan it\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EScore\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nYour score is on your profile page and it’s an equation based on the number of snaps you’ve sent and received,  the stories you posted, and other factors. You can find a friend’s score when you hold down a friend’s name in your contact list, story feed, or chat area. And you can find yours under your Snapcode located in the center of your Profile screen. \n\n\u003Ch4\u003ELenses\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nMake your snaps more fun by adding AR-based special effects and sounds using the  Lenses feature.  To activate lenses, go to the Camera screen in Snapchat, then long-press on your face in the camera view, and lenses will appear in a row next to the capture button.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003E3D World Lenses\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nUnlike Lenses that usually work with a face, World Lenses affect the environment around you. They appear in the same row as Lenses, but only when your camera is facing outward. For instance, a current one shows our Bitmoji avatar mixing potions and chemicals while sitting at a desk.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EFilter\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nYou can jazz up your snap by adding a fun overlay with a filter. After you take a snap, swipe right or left on the preview screen to add colored filters, the current time, local weather, speed overlays, or geofilters to your photo or video. After taking your snap and applying your first filter, you can press and hold and then swipe to add yet another filter, too.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EGeofilter\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nLike filters, you can use a geofilter to decorate snaps. Unlike filters, however, geofilters are specific to your location or an event you’re attending. They encourage other users to share their experiences with friends and followers. On-Demand geofilters may also be designed and purchased by individuals or smaller companies and only become available when a user enters a specified location, such as a wedding or graduation venue.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EMemories\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nSnapchat no longer deletes everything after a short period of time. Memories give you another way to store snaps in Snapchat’s cloud and allow you to store media locally on your device. When you take a snap, you see an option to save it to your Memories where you can organize, edit, search, lock, and share the snap.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EDiscover\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nThis section is located right of the Camera screen and it’s where you find content from brands and publishers. You can find branded content on Discover from Vice, Cosmopolitan, Daily Mail, ESPN, Tastemade, CNN, Buzzfeed, and many more.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EBitmoji\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nWhen you download the  Bitmoji app and create an avatar, you can then link it to your Snapchat account. Your  AR-based lenses now display your avatar and stickers. You could also see “friendmoji” stickers in a chat. Bitmojis are designed to encourage user interaction on Snapchat. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou may also be interested in learning more about:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E \n- [Social Shopping](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2022-social-shopping\u002F \"Social Shopping\")\n- [Social commerce trends in 2022](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2022-social-commerce-trends\u002F \"Social commerce trends in 2022\")\n- [Productsup’s Social Commerce solutions](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"Productsup’s Social Commerce solutions\")\n",assignedCategory:w,relatedTerms:[J,z,W],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:dk,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"snapchat-for-business",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"2hEQT7cKJVGWtu7j4kFuMU",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:p,createdAt:"2022-09-07T08:55:00.912Z",updatedAt:"2022-09-12T08:20:55.125Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:"Glossary term page - Snapchat for business - Compose: SEO",title:dl,description:dm}},openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_6GqHPsYO1WJsTeNjUEEFE0",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:40:02.447Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T12:54:00.479Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:dl,openGraphDescription:dm}}};aj.metadata={tags:[]};aj.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"6BeMjdS6EDXg3gZv1zMNMb",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:k}},revision:am,createdAt:"2022-09-07T08:53:52.672Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T10:51:54.198Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};aj.fields={name:"Glossary term page - TikTok for business - Glossary-Term-Page",header:q,headline:dn,definition:"TikTok For Business is an all-in-one suite used for advertising on the platform.

TikTok allows marketers to establish a bespoke audience for dynamic video advertising at the ad group level. Besides this, one of the most intriguing - and successful - ways to use DSA is to retarget users.

Product feed specifications are requirements set by marketing and selling channels for how product data is formatted for their platforms.  \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EProduct feed specs: in-depth definition\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nAdvertising and shopping channels, such as Google Shopping, Amazon, Instagram, TikTok, and eBay, all set specific guidelines for product data that businesses who sell or advertise on their platforms are required to follow. These product feed specs provide a standard for what product data is needed and how it should be formatted. \n\nFor example, a shopping channel will set [product feed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed\u002F \"Product feed\") specs for how detailed product descriptions are, what terms are used to describe product colors, how many images should be displayed, length parameters for video content, or how size should be scaled on sizing charts. To be an approved seller on a commerce site or run shopping campaigns on a marketing channel, companies need to ensure their product data meets all of these specifications. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy are product feed specs important?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nProduct feed specs play an important role for advertising and shopping channels, as well as for the businesses who need to abide by them. \n\nFor shopping channels, product feed specs ensure that consumers who use their platform have a positive experience. Considering the number of sellers a buyer may encounter while shopping on a single platform, having standardized product feed requirements gives commerce channels some control over their quality of content. \n\nImagine you’re a consumer shopping online. You do a quick search for “light blue mountain bike”. A long list of options pop up that you start to click through. However, you quickly notice that some of the search results aren’t quite what you were looking for. Some of the products are navy blue; some are stationary bikes. The product listings also don’t tell you much about each bike. Some of the images are blurry; some don’t specify the size. You’re likely frustrated by this experience and ready to try a different channel. \n\nPutting product feed specs in place is how the Amazons and Walmarts of the world prevent negative experiences with their brand. By standardizing how every bike brand sets up their product feed, Amazon can ensure you get the information you’re looking for when shopping on its marketplace. \n\nAs for the brands that have to follow product feed specifications, these requirements help them meet consumer expectations and stand out from the competition. According to our Commerce shortfall report, 35% of consumers said receiving more detailed product information is one of the top factors that would entice them to shop with another brand or retailer. \n\nLet’s go back to the bike example. This time, imagine that you’re a bike manufacturer that sells products on Amazon. To meet its channel requirements, you rearrange product title structures, add higher quality images, define all product categories, and add a few other recommended attributions. Once you adjust all of your product information accordingly, you can be confident that your bikes will appear in an optimal format for shoppers on the channel and you’ll get the most out of your listings. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EExample: Google Shopping feed specifications\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nTo help paint the picture, let’s break down the product feed specs for a specific channel: [Google Shopping](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fgoogle-shopping\u002F \"Google shopping\"). \n\nGoogle is the most visited website in the world, receiving more than 64 billion visitors per day, according to Semrush. This makes its shopping functionality a powerful channel for reaching consumers. But how does it remain a reliable commerce channel in the eyes of shoppers? It has strict requirements for vendor eligibility. \n\nBusinesses that want to list their products on Google Shopping need to meet the criteria listed below. \n\nProduct feeds must include the following information: \n- Product ID\n- Title\n- Description\n- Category (according to Google’s category options)\n- URL that links to the product page on the original website\n- URL that links to an image of the product\n- Condition (such as new or gently used)\n- Price\n- Availability (in- or out-of-stock)\n- Shipping fees and timeline\n- Brand name\n- Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)\n- Manufacturer Part Number (MPN)\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EGoogle Shopping feed specifications for product images\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nAdditionally, Google Shopping is one of the many advertising and selling channels that sets the bar high for product images. As ecommerce has grown and it’s become more common for people to buy products online without ever seeing them in-person first, product visuals have become increasingly important. People want to know what an item looks like – and not just from one angle. In a store, you can pick up a shoe, hold it close to your eyes to see detailed patterns, try it on to see how it looks in a mirror, turn it around to see it from the back, and so on. Companies can recreate this effect by providing multiple images taken from a variety of angles. Images should show the product on its own, as well as modeled on a person or in-use. \nTo ensure Google ads and product listings only include high-quality images, Google Shopping has set the following guidelines: \n- DON’T scale images up\n- DON’T submit thumbnails\n- DON’T add borders\n- DON’T include watermarks or logos\n- DON’T use promotional language\n- DON’T use illustrations\n- DO use photos of the real product\n- DO show one product per image\n- DO use aesthetically pleasing images\n\nThere are also more technical image requirements, like file size parameters. For Google Shopping feed specifications, product images must be a minimum of 100 x 100 pixels and a maximum of 64 megapixels. But it’s important to note that these specifications can vary for certain types of products. For instance, the minimum file image file size for clothing products listed on Google Shopping is 250 x 250 pixels.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow to keep up with product feed specifications\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nWhile there are significant upsides to product feed specifications, it’s hard to ignore the obstacles they create for businesses. Getting product data cleaned and optimized according to each channel’s shopping feed specifications can be extremely complex. Without the right strategy and tools in place, it can take companies weeks just to meet channel requirements and use up a lot of human resources. \n\nProduct-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\")) management is a framework designed to help simplify this process.

You also had the option to switch to the mobile app if you wanted to stream from a mobile device.\n\nWhen it was time to stream, either the mobile or desktop app allowed you to go live with your video feed. Facebook put your products according to your playlist in a “featured products” section on-screen. Then it was up to you to promote and actively sell your product to your audience and incentivize them to complete a purchase in-app or on your website.

The tags mean that the users click the tags and are then taken to the seller’s website, or, in the US, they go to an Instagram shop and make the purchase there.\n\nWithout the shopping tags, the posts remain content.

Plan for a phased integration of P2C systems and processes, allowing for employees to become comfortable with the new technology. Have patience in shifting from 2D to 3D commerce, and don’t expect overnight results.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EExpand your boundaries: A lot of companies are timid when expanding to new markets because of the extra resources and local expertise it typically requires. P2C management condenses how product data moves across product information value chains, making it just as easy to reach consumers across the world as it is the ones down the street. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIntegrate P2C company-wide: Marketers aren’t the only ones who benefit from a P2C platform. A strong P2C strategy involves everyone throughout an organization, aligning departments on their individual objectives. Having one central system for product data reduces data silos and increases efficiency. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EReduce IT involvement: One of the greatest strengths of a P2C platform is that it doesn’t require much technical expertise to manage. IT teams don’t need to play a big role in a P2C strategy, so reserve their skills for other projects, such as technological innovation and security. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDiversify channels: P2C management gives you access to thousands of marketing and selling channels. New channels to reach consumers pop up constantly, such as new trending social platforms, online marketplaces, or media groups. Don’t just rely on the same export channels you’ve been using forever; experiment with your omnichannel presence as part of your P2C strategy.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFind the right P2C platform: Every P2C strategy needs a strong P2C platform to drive it. Choose a platform that includes automations to remove manual tasks, can handle high volumes of data, integrate well with other systems, and provide analytics on performance data.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EPay attention to feedback loops: With a P2C strategy, you’ll need a 3D commerce approach where information flows in multiple directions. This means you’ll have clear access to data on customer feedback, stock levels, returns, and more. Use this information to improve other parts of your business, such as customer service and supply chain management. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBe agile: Given the pace of change in the commerce space, a P2C strategy should allow you to make adjustments quickly to stay on top of the latest trends, expand to new channels, and follow consumer preferences.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EInnovate: Take the opportunity to be proactive in using advanced technologies and forward-thinking trends. Instead of following what others in the market are doing, use P2C to give yourself a competitive advantage. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EEvaluate your success: P2C management provides clear visibility into performance and insights on shopping patterns.

If you're an online seller, you're likely aware of Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon). However, there's another powerful option at your disposal - Amazon FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant). In this guide, we will unravel the world of Amazon FBM, exploring what it is, its benefits, and why it's a game-changer for eCommerce entrepreneurs. \n\nLet’s take a look at the Fulfillment by Merchant?\n\n## What is amazon FBM?\n\nAmazon FBM, or Fulfillment by Merchant, is a service provided by Amazon that allows sellers to fulfill their own orders directly to customers. In contrast to Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), where Amazon handles the storage, packaging, and shipping of products, FBM gives sellers full control over these aspects of their business. \n\nWith FBM, sellers are responsible for managing their own inventory, packaging products, arranging for shipping, and providing customer service. This means that sellers store their inventory in their own warehouses or facilities and handle the entire fulfillment process themselves.\n\nBy utilizing FBM, sellers can take advantage of the Amazon platform while maintaining control over their operations. They have the flexibility to customize packaging, include promotional inserts, and maintain direct communication with customers. This level of control allows sellers to create a unique and personalized experience for their buyers.\n\nUnlike Amazon FBA, where Amazon handles these tasks, FBM puts you in the driver's seat.\n\n## Unconventional uses of FBM for eCommerce success\n\nWhile FBM is commonly used for order fulfillment, it can also be leveraged in unconventional ways to boost e-commerce success.\n\n- __Dropshipping Expansion:__ By combining FBM with dropshipping, sellers can expand their product offerings without the need for inventory management. This allows them to partner with suppliers who directly ship products to customers, offering a wider range of products and reaching new markets.\n\n- __Multi-Channel Fulfillment:__ FBM can be integrated with multiple eCommerce platforms, such as a seller's own website or other marketplaces. This enables sellers to centralize inventory management and streamline fulfillment processes across different channels, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n- __Customized Bundles and Kits:__ FBM empowers sellers to create customized bundles or kits by combining complementary products. This unique offering adds value for customers and sets sellers apart from their competitors. Customized bundles can encourage larger purchases and drive sales.\n\n- __Seasonal and Limited Edition Offerings:__ FBM allows sellers to quickly introduce seasonal or limited edition products to capitalize on trends and create a sense of urgency among customers. Having control over inventory and fulfillment enables sellers to manage and fulfill orders for these special offerings, boosting sales and generating excitement around their brand.\n\n- __Branding and Packaging:__ FBM provides sellers with the opportunity to showcase their brand identity through customized packaging and branding materials. Creating a memorable unboxing experience enhances brand loyalty and differentiates products in a crowded marketplace. Unique packaging can leave a lasting impression on customers and encourage repeat purchases.\n\nThese unconventional uses of FBM offer sellers various ways to expand their product range, reach new customers, increase sales, and build strong brand connections. By leveraging FBM in these innovative ways, sellers can achieve eCommerce success and stand out in a competitive market.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"padding:20px;background:#d2f3fd;font-size:1.2rem;border-radius:5px;\"\u003E\n  \u003Ch4 style=\"font-size:1.7rem;font-weight: 600;\"\u003EFuel your revenue on Amazon Marketplace with Productsup.\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nMarketplaces PX enables you to easily import and enrich your product content.

FBM is suitable for sellers who want more control, customization, and cost efficiency. It is ideal for sellers with unique or oversized products, as well as those who have their own fulfillment capabilities and prefer to maintain direct contact with customers.\n\nOn the other hand, FBA offers advantages such as Amazon Prime eligibility, access to Amazon's vast customer base, and hassle-free fulfillment. It is a great option for sellers who prioritize speed, convenience, and scalability.\n\nMaking the right choice depends on factors such as product type, volume, profit margins, and desired level of involvement. Sellers should analyze their specific requirements and compare the benefits of both FBM and FBA to determine the most suitable fulfillment strategy for their business.\n\n### Navigating challenges in FBM: Pitfalls and solutions\n\nWhile FBM offers numerous benefits, it also presents its own set of challenges. One common challenge is managing inventory effectively. Sellers need to maintain accurate stock levels, prevent stockouts, and ensure timely replenishment. Implementing robust inventory management systems and utilizing data analytics can help sellers overcome these challenges.\n\nAnother challenge is shipping logistics. FBM sellers need to establish efficient shipping processes, select reliable carriers, and negotiate competitive shipping rates. It is crucial to invest in order management systems and shipping automation tools to streamline the fulfillment process and reduce shipping costs.\n\nCustomer service is another critical aspect in FBM. Sellers must be prepared to handle customer inquiries, returns, and any issues that may arise. Prompt and effective communication is key to maintaining customer satisfaction. Implementing a well-structured customer service system and utilizing customer relationship management (CRM) software can help sellers provide exceptional support to their customers.\n\nBy proactively identifying and addressing these challenges, sellers can optimize their FBM operations and ensure a smooth fulfillment process.\n\n### The future of FBM: Trends and innovations\n\nThe Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM) model has been evolving to meet the changing needs of eCommerce sellers. Here are some trends and innovations that are shaping the future of FBM:\n\n- __Automation and Technology:__ As technology continues to advance, automation is becoming increasingly prevalent in fulfillment processes. Sellers are leveraging tools like inventory management systems, order management software, and robotics to streamline operations, reduce errors, and improve efficiency. Automated order processing, tracking, and shipping can help sellers scale their FBM operations and handle increased order volumes.\n\n- __Predictive Analytics and AI:__ Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) are playing a crucial role in optimizing FBM operations. By analyzing historical data and customer behavior patterns, sellers can make data-driven decisions regarding inventory management, pricing, and demand forecasting. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are also being used to enhance customer service and provide personalized support.\n\n- __Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Practices:__ With growing environmental concerns, sellers are increasingly adopting eco-friendly practices in their FBM operations. This includes using recyclable packaging materials, implementing energy-efficient processes, and optimizing shipping routes to minimize carbon emissions. By prioritizing sustainability, sellers can appeal to environmentally conscious consumers and differentiate themselves in the market.\n\n- __Omnichannel Integration:__ FBM sellers are expanding their presence beyond traditional marketplaces and integrating with various sales channels, including social media platforms, mobile apps, and brick-and-mortar stores. This omnichannel approach allows sellers to reach a wider audience, provide a seamless shopping experience, and leverage multiple touchpoints to drive sales.\n\nThese trends and innovations in FBM are shaping the future of eCommerce fulfillment. By embracing these advancements, sellers can optimize their operations, improve customer satisfaction, and stay ahead in a competitive market.\n\nAmazon FBM presents a world of opportunities for e-commerce sellers. By taking control of fulfillment processes, sellers can optimize costs, enhance their brand, and provide a tailored customer experience. Whether you are a small business owner or an established seller, leveraging Amazon FBM can unlock new levels of success in the competitive e-commerce landscape.\n\nNow that you have a comprehensive understanding of Amazon FBM, it's time to explore the possibilities and take your online business to new heights!\n\nAmazon offers not only FBA and FBM but also operates as a vast [marketplace](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Famazon-marketplace\u002F), encompassing both [1P](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002F1p-marketplace\u002F) (First-Party) and [3P](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002F3p-marketplace\u002F) (Third-Party) models.

Users can then browse collections from other Pinterest users. \n\nPinterest is available as a mobile app – iOS and Android –  or on desktop using Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge and a mac with the Pinterest Safari browser extension.\n\nPinterest is the 14th biggest social platform with over 442 million users. They are around 60% female and still predominantly found in the United States. The company has been growing rapidly outside the US since 2020.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow does Pinterest work?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nAs you can guess from the name, Pinterest is a virtual version of an old-fashioned pinboard or notice board.  Users can manage their boards using a whole range of organizational and bookmarking tools.\n\nIf you’re interested in something like painting, cooking, or fashion, you will find images related to what you like on Pinterest or the web, then you can save them – or pin them– to your Pinterest board. You can create multiple bulletin boards to list what you are interested in. For example,  you could create a landscape board for your painting interests, a vegetarian board for your cooking hobby, or an interior board to showcase your decorating interests. \n\nPinterest is also a very active social network and users interact by following each other and liking or commenting on other users’ boards. You can save another user's images to your boards and then exchange private messages with them to discuss your shared interests further.\n\nWhen you click on a Pinterest image, you are redirected to the image's original site, where you can learn more about the thing you saw.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow to set up your Pinterest Business account?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nTo start running ads on Pinterest, go to pinterest.com and sign up for a Pinterest Business account. Navigate to the bottom of the pop-up and click “Get started here!”. Add your business email, and your age, and create a secure password. Make sure your email address isn’t connected to any other Pinterest account, then click “Create account”. You’ll then be asked to add your business’s name, language, and location.\n\nDescribe your business in a way that honestly and clearly describes what it does, then add a link to your website. Now you can start advertising your content and products on Pinterest.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat kind of marketing is Pinterest suitable for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nPinterest’s users are engaged and overwhelmingly positive – they come to the site looking for creative ideas –  which makes them very active and interested in the content. The majority of users and users who shop on the site are female.\n\nPinterest was initially an excellent way to push brands to new audiences looking for new things and to drive new traffic to a website or store. But the platform is now a complete [social commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"Social Commerce\") platform because it has integrated a checkout into its user experience – in the US to start. The checkout is hosted by Shopify, but it appears to the Pinterest users as native. The users can now click on items, select size, color, or other attributes, and then purchase in the app.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EPinterest glossary\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EPinner\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nA Pinner is a term for a person who uses Pinterest.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EPins\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nA Pin is a primary post which includes images or videos that link back to the original source.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EPromoted Pins\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nPromoted Pins are a kind of ad.

Data feeds don’t just include apparent properties such as product images, titles, SKUs, product identifiers, marketing content, and product features, but they have all the information that the seller or provider wants to display. So, think shipping, availability, sales events, and any relevant channel-specific features (see [product feed specifications](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed-specifications\u002F) for more)\n\nOnce you have imported your product data into your [product-to-consumer](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fp2c-product-to-consumer\u002F) (P2C) platform or [Advertising PX](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fadvertising-px\u002F) solution, you will have to map all of the data onto the attributes each channel  requires. Once the export product data feed is ready for export, after the product information has been cleaned and enhanced for that channel, the feed will be exported in whatever format the channel requires. \n\nA comprehensive P2C platform will automate almost all of the labor-intensive manual tasks listed above before exporting the  CSV, TXT, XML, or JSON files. It goes without saying that an Amazon product data feed or a Google product data feed will differ greatly from, say, a Facebook product data feed.\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy do I need to manage my product data feed?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\nThe importance of creating accurate and up-to-date product feeds for ecommerce businesses must be considered. Strategic, methodical, and best-in-class [product feed optimization](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002Fbest-practices-for-product-feed-optimization\u002F) will lead to better customer buying experiences, improved brand recognition, and lower return rates. Accurate and high-quality product feed data leads to more sales.\n\nWith digital complexity and commerce anarchy increasing, organizations must automate more of their manual ecommerce data feed processes in order to keep up with the rapidly changing ecommerce product data ecosystems.\n\nThe advantage of automated, smart product data feed management means much more than just increased conversions, it also means pushing ahead of your competitors utilizing big commerce product feeds who may still need help understanding why product data management is becoming so labor-intensive and complex.\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhat if I don’t have a strong product feed management tool in place?\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\nNot prioritizing the integration of a comprehensive product feed management platform into your tech stack could have a whole range of consequences. Primarily, modern P2C solutions all use the latest AI innovations to automate product data feed tasks. This means that managing the complexities of the [ecommerce digital space](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fdigital-shelf\u002F) can be carried out by a small tema.\n\nBusinesses that onboard new solutions will free up time and resources to optimize and enhance their product data for the channels where they sell. This is important in the growing [social commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F) space where video and dynamic images are vital to maintaining brand trust and customer loyalty.\n\nLow visibility will affect the brand and will lead to fewer conversions. Inaccurate information, on the other hand, can even lead to higher return rates and negative customer reviews.\n\n\u003Ch2\u003EBest practices optimizing product feeds\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\nOnce you have automatically imported and correctly mapped your product data in your feed platform, you will want to spend some time optimizing your data for the sales channels you are targeting. Feed solutions, such as Advertising PX, have multitudes of rule boxes, and other tools, like the Video and Image Designer, enable marketing teams to make bulk improvements to whole feeds and optimize tens of thousands of SKUs in a matter of seconds.\n\nThese tools can be used to write effective product descriptions or turn images into dynamic ads or videos. Rule boxes can change the language in descriptions or help organize the product information for better searchability on the platforms or marketplaces it’s displayed.\n\nProduct-to-consumer solutions providers offer services that automate the amendment to data required to quickly switch the data for feeds from one export channel to another. You only require one data import feed in order to create export feeds for, say, Amazon, [Google](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fgoogle-shopping-feed\u002F), Instagram or Facebook. Simply move the data from one preconfigured channel template to another and then check to see if the data has to be further optimized for that channel – even if it’s just an XML product data feed for a channel you lack a template.\n\nYour product data feed software should also offer data analysis tools, A\u002FB testing for your marketing campaigns on sales channels. Think about how you might need to optimize an export feed for Shopify product feed requirements, recommendations and according to industry best practices.\n\n\u003Ch2\u003E Common challenges facing ecommerce business and  how to overcome them\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\n- It's time-consuming! Regarding ecommerce, time is a valuable resource, so we all prioritize our business objectives according to our free time. It takes time to launch a new channel, a new campaign for a new collection, or a significant product launch and time to realize what is and isn’t working. Making amends for mistakes is a good strategy, but we should strive for quick learning.\n\n- Limited impressions and clicks lead to lower ROAS and higher CPC: The caliber of your ecommerce data feeds impacts the effectiveness of your campaigns when you list your [product catalog](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-catalog\u002F) on ecommerce channels. A poor-quality feed gets fewer clicks and impressions. This happens because you’re missing some product types or attributes, not accurately describing your products, or your titles and images don’t fully support your bidding strategy.\n\n- Stock and availability issues! Overselling and wrong orders are around the corner, ready to waste your money: Keeping orders coordinated and [inventory](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-inventory\u002F) properly managed is one of the biggest challenges for ecommerce businesses with multiple countries, channels, and warehouses in use. It frequently happens for businesses to sell items that are out of stock. Overselling impacts the entire customer experience and is difficult to manage.\n\n- No time to test! The processes to conduct manual A\u002FB testing on your feeds are lengthy and complicated: To increase your key performance indicators, such as clicks, impressions, CTR, and ultimately ROAD, you must A\u002FB test your feeds. However, online stores don’t have a plan for quarterly testing because testing different product types, images, titles, descriptions, and other product information takes time and involves numerous manual steps. The advantages vs. drawbacks ratio is frequently overlooked.\n\n- Need more control over sales channels! Your product data needs to be accurate and relevant to your customers while also meeting the requirements of each digital channel if you want to promote your catalog through those channels successfully. Building your feeds manually is a cumbersome process, and manually managed product data is challenging to organize, navigate, and understand. You’ll overlook common mistakes and inaccuracies, and your products might completely miss an opportunity to appear.\n\n- Lack of accuracy! A critical success factor when selling online is being able to collect and manipulate data while taking action accordingly. When it comes to a product data feed, its analysis can be cumbersome, and slicing and dicing data (and feeds) can be complex. Segmenting and labeling products in your catalog can be challenging for many marketers, but it’s crucial for your campaigns.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E How can Productsup help me overcome these challenges\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nProductsup offers a best-in-class product-to-consumer product feed management solution that can address and overcome all of the challenges listed above, and much more.

From product discovery to the final point of purchase, consumers can carry out each part of the shopping journey in whatever channel they so choose – TikTok, Amazon, Google Shopping, eBay, and more. It’s then up to businesses to ensure the information, branding, and customer service is consistent at every touchpoint. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy is omnichannel marketing important?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nIn today’s competitive commerce climate, companies need to have an omnichannel strategy. It has become the norm among marketing and sales teams as businesses look to grow their customer base and expand to new markets. \n\n- Consumer expectations are increasing.\u003Cbr\u003EConsumer expectations have been rising for quite some time, and they’re not slowing down. People want same-day and free deliveries for online orders, ads that are tailored to their personal interests, and seamless transactions that don’t require more than a couple of clicks. Because of these demands, brands and retailers have been forced to adapt – or else they risk losing out to those that do. They need to be everywhere the customer is, and they need to be there with up-to-date, relevant information. \n- New channels are emerging.\u003Cbr\u003EFrom online marketplaces to social commerce, the number of channels to reach consumers is accelerating exceptionally fast. Retailers are launching their own media groups, DTC brands are launching their own marketplaces, social platforms are launching their own shops, and the list goes on and on. Companies have more opportunity than ever before to reach their target audiences in niche locations and in authentic environments. \n- The competition is growing.\u003Cbr\u003EThe gaps between the big, middle, and small commerce players are widening. Hyperscalers have the resources needed to adapt to changing consumer expectations and adopt emerging channels. Companies need an omnichannel strategy to prevent losing customers to competitors. \n- Economic pressure is rising.\u003Cbr\u003ESupply and demand has shifted to all extremes in the last few years in response to various economic factors. This has created major strains on supply chains, which have caused operating costs to rise for many companies. Businesses can’t just rely on their current customer base to survive during the unexpected downturns. An omnichannel approach is needed to allow room for growth in new markets and verticals. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EExample of an omnichannel customer journey\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nLet’s pretend you’re looking to buy a new pair of running shoes. You don’t have an immediate need to purchase them, so you want to take your time in making the right investment. \n\nYou start the journey by doing a simple Google search for “best running shoes”. You skim through a few blogs that people have written analyzing various brands and styles. While you’re on those blogs, you notice an ad for New Balance running shoes. \n\nYou meander over to the Google Shopping tab to see what options are listed there. You scroll through a few pages and make note of a few items that you like from Adidas and Reebok before closing the browser for the day. \n\nA week later you’re scrolling on Instagram and come across a pair of Nike shoes that Serena Williams is wearing in a picture she posted. You notice there’s a link in the post that directs you to the product page on the app. You save it for later and continue scrolling. \n\nNow that you have a few ideas of running shoes you like, you decide to head to your local sports retailer to see them in-person and try them on. You fall in love with a pair of Brooks, but they don’t have the right size and they’re a little more expensive than you would have preferred. You leave the store in hopes to find a better price and fit online. \n\nBack online, you visit a few price comparison sites and marketplaces such as Amazon to make sure you’re getting the best value. You’re almost confident with your choice but aren’t ready to pull the trigger just yet. \n\nA few days later, you’re scrolling on [Facebook](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Ffacebook-dynamic-ads\u002F \"Facebook\") when an ad pops up for the exact pair of Brooks running shoes you’ve been considering purchasing. The ad shows a picture of an athlete modeling the shoes, and you decide you have to have them. You close Facebook and go to Brooks’ online store to purchase them directly from the brand. \n\nAfter weeks of visiting various channels and coming across personalized ads, the customer journey finally ends. This type of path – one that bounces around from channel to channel – demonstrates omnichannel commerce, and it’s what businesses should expect and prepare for.  \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow can you provide a strong omnichannel customer experience?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nThe key to being the brand, retailer, or marketplace that secures the purchase at the end of the customer journey is to provide a compelling presence at every touchpoint. A compelling omnichannel customer experience means product information in ads and listings is high-quality, accurate, consistent, and tailored to each channel. \n\nHowever, managing product data spread out across hundreds of thousands of channels, whilst adding new channels as they pop up, is extremely difficult for many businesses. Most companies use multiple systems to manage their product data, which creates silos and room for error. It can also be extremely time-consuming to make individual changes per channel manually, slowing down updates to outdated information. This complexity, known as [commerce anarchy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fcommerce-anarchy\u002F \"commerce anarchy\"), can make an omnichannel approach nearly impossible to maintain.   \nThe only way to successfully execute omnichannel commerce is with product-to-consumer ([P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\")) management, where data is streamlined as it moves throughout the [product information value chain](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-information-value-chain\u002F \"product information value chain\").

The format allows you to find the right target audience for your products, ensuring that they are shown relevant, personalized product ads. The ads can be coupled with Facebook’s personalisation and retargeting capabilities in order to tailor content based on consumers’ previous actions and interest signals. The ads can then be utilized on Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network eliminating the need to create individual ads everywhere. Initially introduced for retail products, there are now also dedicated formats available for certain verticals, e.g. travel ads, automotive inventory ads, and dynamic ads for property.\n\nFacebook dynamic ads can be leveraged in two different ways, to target a broad audience who have not been to your site yet, or to retarget previous website or social media page visitors who showed interest in your products but did not convert yet.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow do dynamic ads work in Facebook ads?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nIn order to run Facebook dynamic ads, you need the Facebook pixel or SDK, a business manager account, and a [product catalog](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-catalog\u002F \"Product catalog\"). To get started you only need to upload your product catalog ([product feed](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed\u002F \"Product feed\")) and set up a campaign once. The product feed can be created with the help of a [P2C platform](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fp2c-platform\u002F \"P2C platform\") that centralizes your product data from multiple sources like PIM and shop systems.\n\nOnce set up, Facebook dynamic ads allow you to generate and serve up millions of unique ads. Product information like brand names and shipping information gets extracted and converted into ads for Facebook users. The ads can come in single-image, carousels, or collections. These can also be used on Instagram and Audience Network.  \n\nFacebook dynamic ads are widely scalable as they get generated from your entire product catalog in an automated manner. As one ad gets created, Facebook automatically extracts relevant information like prices and availability from your product data feed to show them to specific target audiences. It ensures that up-to-date pricing and availability are displayed at any time. Due to a rich pool of audience information, detailed tracking, and intelligent algorithms, Facebook is able to direct ads to users based on relevance. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003E How ad targeting works with FDA\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nIn order to optimally reach your target audience with Facebook dynamic product ads, it is important to use the personalization and retargeting capabilities of the platform. This helps you to show people product ads tailored to their interests even if they have not visited your site or app before. On top, it will remind shoppers who visited your online or mobile app of the items they recently viewed but didn’t purchase yet.\n\nIn addition to showing the users the exact products that they showed interest in, Facebook dynamic ads help you target users based on the stage of the sales funnel they are in, e.g. after they signed up for a newsletter, abandoned their cart, or completed a purchase.\n\nThe dynamic content can be delivered on any device and reaches unique users across different devices as long as they are logged into their Facebook accounts.\n\nFacebook allows you to monitor and optimize the performance of your ad campaigns. They offer a range of tools and features that help you understand your audiences on Facebook and in your shop as well as test which campaign settings prove to have the best impact on your overall marketing and sales success.\n\nUltimately, Facebook is a powerful [social commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"Social commerce\") platform for any brand and retailer when it comes to investing in digital marketing efforts.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EExamples for dynamic product ads on Facebook\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nBesides showcasing retail products on Facebook, you also have the option to use the dynamic format to create industry-specific ads for travel, automotive, and real estate. In the following, you will find an example for each of these formats.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003ETravel ads\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nFacebook dynamic ads offer you the possibility to match the travel interests of users with items from your travel catalog. In case, someone was browsing for a holiday trip but hasn’t decided on a hotel or flight yet, you can show them travel ads that contain their specific travel dates, destination, or price range. For example, “Trip to Madrid, from 300 €, available between August 15th to 22nd”. Prices and availability can be updated automatically.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EAutomotive inventory ads\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nThis format enables you to match potential car buyers with the perfect vehicle. By uploading your vehicle catalog, including details like model, year, and make, you can attract users to check out your vehicle listings on your website, fill in lead submission forms, or other relevant information sources. \n\n\u003Ch4\u003EDynamic ads for property\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nDynamic ads for property help you advertise new home listings to the right target audience. Whether someone is interested in renting or buying a new property, you are able to showcase the most attractive places based on data points like the number of bedrooms, neighborhood, price, size, and more. Note that you need at least 100 property listings in order to use this function.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou may also be interested in learning more about:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E \n- [Productsup’s Social Commerce solution](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Fsocial-commerce\u002F \"Social Commerce\")\n- [The Product Content Syndication solution](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fsolutions\u002Fproduct-content-syndication\u002F \"The Product Content Syndication solution\")",assignedCategory:w,relatedTerms:[ax,z,ai,J],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:dp,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"facebook-dynamic-ads",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"qRWLXX3EF9OdEuIwCDbns",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:p,createdAt:"2022-09-07T08:52:46.311Z",updatedAt:"2022-09-12T08:22:40.673Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:"Glossary term page - Facebook dynamic ads - Compose: SEO",title:dq,description:dr}},openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_73xGr85PexwqZnlw2nIQuJ",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:39:38.652Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T12:54:05.205Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:dq,openGraphDescription:dr}}};aX.metadata={tags:[]};aX.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:u,id:"2nCczAFdSdde0EfhhnYYX8",revision:118,createdAt:"2021-10-22T09:01:07.221Z",updatedAt:"2024-01-29T13:05:53.640Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};aX.fields={title:aY,description:aY,file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fq17uls4wkkdz\u002F2nCczAFdSdde0EfhhnYYX8\u002F10b1ba2dc3f30d086405908f25ef02ca\u002Fpup_logo_rebrand.svg",details:{size:3562,image:{width:1202,height:301}},fileName:"pup_logo_rebrand.svg",contentType:x}};aZ.metadata={tags:[]};aZ.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"3t8JOrXvHLx9PHq06HBO9Z",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:n}},revision:39,createdAt:"2021-07-08T14:47:05.051Z",updatedAt:"2023-10-12T14:32:43.566Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};aZ.fields={name:"Platform Overview - Core-Page",title:"Platform overview",urlSubfolder:s,slug:"platform"};a_.metadata={tags:[]};a_.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"1MyGGG4sF7Eeh88tQx5HVA",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:n}},revision:a$,createdAt:"2021-10-18T08:43:46.442Z",updatedAt:"2023-12-01T10:42:20.640Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};a_.fields={name:"LP - 2021 - Campaign LP - Product to Consumer - Core-Page",title:"Product-to-Consumer (P2C) strategy",urlSubfolder:s,slug:ba,openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_1MyGGG4sF7Eeh88tQx5HVA",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:27:31.656Z",updatedAt:"2023-12-01T10:41:19.699Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:"Introducing P2C: Product-to-Consumer",openGraphDescription:"Smart Product-to-Consumer management powered by a P2C platform counteracts the negative impact of commerce complexity on global business.

They represent the path that product data flows as it moves across the commerce ecosystem. Without PIVCs, a product – along with its product information – can’t effectively move from a supplier to commerce channels, and ultimately, to consumers. \n\nIn properly managed PIVCs, product data is synchronized across all targeted sales channels and their respective audiences. This means that product information is adjusted according to a platform’s [product feed specifications](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-feed-specifications\u002F \"product feed specifications\"), as well as the target audience’s expectations.\n\nProduct information calue chains can contain various types of data, including:\n- Supply chain logistics\n- Product information\n- Social media signals\n\n*(Note: PIVCs can sometimes be referred to as Product Data Value Chains (PDVCs) in the ecommerce space.)*\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy is PIVC management important?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nTo not fall victim to the perils of [commerce anarchy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fcommerce-anarchy\u002F \"commerce anarchy\"), a PIVC needs to be managed using the right strategy. Only then, all product information is funneled efficiently and flexibly according to thousands of commerce channels and platforms and their millions of users. In short, neglecting PIVC management means product data can become lost, corrupt, confusing, and\u002For incorrect, which can lead to consumer ignorance, avoidance, and even frustration. Faulty product data leads to poor consumer experiences, and eventually, lost revenue.\n\nThe rising complexity of commerce also means that the number of PIVCs that today’s organizations have to manage are rising. More marketing and selling channels are emerging in the digital commerce landscape and consumers’ behavior and expectations are constantly changing. These inconsistent variables lead to PIVC management becoming increasingly complicated and resource-heavy to maintain.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow do you take control of product information value chains?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nTaking control of product information value chains means avoiding faulty, missing, and incomplete product data, and making sure that the data is complete, its flow is secure, and the product information package is perfectly tailored to its destination.\n\nThe most effective way to keep PIVCs in check is with product-to-consumer (P2C) management. P2C management provides complete control over product catalogs, product feeds, and ultimately, the crucial syndication of product content. \n\nP2C enables you to cross the otherwise insurmountable barrier of commerce anarchy because it cuts right through the complexity of the ecommerce landscape. In the past, businesses tried to control their product data via manual catalog management, spending hours upon hours manually adjusting bits of product data so they fit a certain channel’s requirements and a complicated audience’s expectations. In essence, the more manual steps you have to take in your product feed management and [product content syndication](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-content-syndication\u002F \"product content syndication\") efforts, the greater chance for errors in product listings and ads. \n\nA P2C platform, in turn, automates most of these processes and corrects corrupt product data with ease, allowing you to “take control of your PIVCs” and take an important step in your organization’s P2C maturity.\n\nYou may also be interested in learning more about: \n- [The P2C transformation process and maturity model](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2022-the-p2c-maturity-model\u002F \"The P2C transformation process and maturity model\")\n- [The 2023 feed management guide](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fguides\u002Fthe-2023-feed-management-guide\u002F \"The 2023 feed management guide\")",assignedCategory:G,relatedTerms:[Z,t,W,aA],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:bX,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"product-information-value-chain",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"5e6Ki1wIILooM3FmUQL1mM",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:p,createdAt:"2022-09-07T09:48:39.429Z",updatedAt:"2022-09-12T08:20:11.084Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:"Glossary term page - Product information value chain - Compose: SEO",title:dN,description:dO}},openGraphMetaData:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"og_5A7wNPGdvQV2xK2iCtw3v9",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:j}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-01-18T10:39:57.454Z",updatedAt:"2023-01-18T12:54:01.389Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{openGraphTitle:dN,openGraphDescription:dO}}};cl.metadata={tags:[]};cl.sys={space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"4sg2295ms4jxVzHzhR2kSg",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:k}},revision:M,createdAt:"2022-09-08T12:45:02.265Z",updatedAt:"2024-01-17T13:08:27.232Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b};cl.fields={name:"Glossary term page - Product data syndication - Glossary-Term-Page",header:q,headline:cm,definition:"Product data syndication – also known as [Product Content Syndication](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-content-syndication\u002F \"Product Content Syndication\") (PCS) – describes the management and distribution of product data – usually via product feeds –  to ecommerce sales platforms, websites, and marketplaces with clean data that matches the requirements of those sales channels. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EIn-depth definition of product data syndication\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nThe data is imported, merged, enhanced, and then synchronized across multiple feeds – to ensure data consistency – and then syndicated or distributed to however many sales channels desired by the manufacturer, producer, or suppliers.\n\nProduct data syndication is a more comprehensive term for all of the processes that must be executed to get products direct from manufacturers and producers out to consumers who are shopping on retailer websites or marketplaces shopping. It is also the system that synchronizes and syndicates the product data required for direct-to-consumer marketing strategies.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy is product data syndication software important?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nAn excellent product data syndication software or a [product-to-consumer platform](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fp2c-platform\u002F \"product-to-consumer platform\") with product data syndication capabilities is not just important, and it is now essential for businesses struggling to manage multiple channels in large markets or even across multiple markets. \n\nThe digital transformation of the past 10 years has meant that the paths stretching between consumers and suppliers have become torturously difficult to navigate. Where manufacturers, producers, and small brands used to directly market on their websites, the proliferation of channels – not to mention the impact of globalization and the digital transformation since 2020 – has had a choking effect on the marketing efforts of these companies looking to distribute their products.\n\nKnown as [commerce anarchy](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fcommerce-anarchy\u002F \"commerce anarchy\"), the obfustication of the digital space into a labyrinthine mesh of interconnected portals, channels, platforms and websites which are all supposed to facilitate a brand having consistent messaging across all touch points of the consumers.\n\nCommerce anarchy also describes the negative effect of marketing IT teams’ attempts to navigate these confusing paths. They are completely a lot of manual work and the result is: slow turnaround times on product feeds, slow time-to-market for new products, inaccurate information on product listings such as price or availability, and inconsistent messaging and branding across all touchpoints. This is all culminating in the server brand damage  =and erosion of consumer trust.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhy a P2C platform is best suited for today’s product data\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nA [P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\") product data syndication solution enables anyone in an organization – even those without IT skills – to enhance and share superior product data which will provide excellent consumer experiences. A good platform enables manufacturers, producers and brands to merge, enhance, synchronize then syndicate high-quality product information by automating the integration of product feed data into channel-specific templates. These templates are where the data is synchronized for brand consistency.  Due to the huge spectra of requirements and formatting, your product data syndication tools should be able to connect the syndicated data to any platform in any format. \n\nYour product data syndication tool should:\n\n- Synchronize and consolidate: import, categorize, and clean product data files of any size and being imparted from any source.\n- Enhance and optimize: delete errors, test data quality, prepare the data for the required channels \n- Enrich and market:  Add marketing copy and ads to the product data, prepare and schedule the order availability, pricing and whatever sales events the marketing team is planning.\n- Export and publish: export and syndicate the now consistently synchronized channel-ready data to whatever channels\n\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow do manufacturers, producers and retailers benefit from automated product information syndication?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\nBecause manual feed and product data maintenance is no longer an option. Automation and the use of AI-powered data systems is not just about adding value to the product information chains, it’s about surviving in the market. Automation is essential for a number of reasons listed below.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EMeeting channel requirements\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nWherever you publish your product data, there are always a lot of requirements and specs that have to be just too slow and are error prone. Product data syndication solutions map content from several levels including taxonomy using artificial intelligence.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EData merging from multiple sources\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nWhen you import product content from multiple sources or multiple systems from one source, the data has to be merged in your system. It goes without saying that all data sources from, say, content providers or direct suppliers, use many different data models and formats. A good product data syndication commerce solution merges all the required information and displays them in a centralized dashboard. To do this manually requires a lot of time and resources.\n\n\u003Ch4\u003EAutomated product content syndication across as many channels as you want\u003C\u002Fh4\u003E\nIf you share your product data with more than one sales channel or you are operating in multiple markets, each export feed that is published will have to be adjusted accordingly. Your product data syndication portal changes the product content into the required format for all your target retail partners. Automatic feed uploads mean that you can rest assured that your feeds can be regularly uploaded to the publishers' site(s) without any errors and with the latest pricing and availability data.

This is where the Global Product Classification system provided by GS1 comes into play. Businesses can achieve greater accuracy, reliability, and interoperability across their operations by implementing a standardized approach to product categorization and coding.\n\n### The role of GS1 standards in product identification\nAt the heart of the Global Product Classification system are the GS1 standards. These standards enable businesses to uniquely identify and classify their products, ensuring consistency and compatibility throughout the supply chain. By leveraging these standards, companies can assign Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) to their products, enabling efficient tracking, inventory management, and seamless data exchange between trading partners.\n\n### Enhancing customer experience with accurate product information\n\nAccurate and comprehensive product information is essential for a positive customer experience. With the Global Product Classification system, businesses can ensure that product details, specifications, and images are standardized and readily available to consumers. By leveraging GS1 standards, companies can enhance the online and offline shopping experience, enable easy product comparison, and build trust by providing reliable and consistent [product information](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fproduct-content-management\u002F).\n\n### Enabling seamless product information exchange\n\nEffective product information exchange is critical for collaboration between trading partners. GS1's Global Product Classification system enables businesses to share standardized product data seamlessly, regardless of location or operational systems. This streamlined information exchange promotes efficient decision-making, minimizes data discrepancies, and fosters stronger partnerships throughout the supply chain.\n\n  \u003Ch3\u003EEnsuring data integrity and quality control\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nIn global product classification, data integrity and quality control are paramount. Businesses need to ensure that product data is accurate, complete, and consistent to avoid costly errors and miscommunication. GS1's Global Product Classification system provides a framework for maintaining data integrity by establishing standardized data fields and validation rules. \n\nThis helps companies enforce data quality control measures, reducing the risk of incorrect product identification, pricing discrepancies, and logistical errors. By implementing data integrity practices within the classification process, businesses can enhance operational efficiency, build trust with trading partners, and improve overall customer satisfaction.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003E Best practices for implementing global product classification \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nImplementing Global Product Classification requires careful planning and execution. Best practices for successful implementation include defining clear data governance policies, educating employees on GS1 standards, integrating classification processes into existing workflows, establishing data synchronization mechanisms with trading partners, and regularly monitoring and auditing data quality. By following these best practices, businesses can ensure a smooth transition to a standardized product classification system and maximize its benefits.\n\n\u003Ch3\u003ECheck out the following resources for further learning:\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\n- [10 ways poor data quality affects brands](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2023-ten-ways-poor-data-quality-affects-brands\u002F)\n- [The role of GDSN in modern commerce](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002Fgdsn-content-databases\u002F)\n- [Does your product data meet global standards?](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fblog\u002F2023-product-data-global-standards-gs1-gdsn\u002F)",assignedCategory:H,relatedTerms:[B,_,aa],filterBar:m,footer:r,title:da,urlSubfolder:l,slug:"gs1",seo:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:c,id:d}},type:g,id:"7IxL5XJnnVsvfp5E3pzYnk",contentType:{sys:{type:a,linkType:h,id:o}},revision:i,createdAt:"2023-08-04T09:24:56.715Z",updatedAt:"2023-08-08T08:15:27.711Z",environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},locale:b},fields:{name:c$,title:"GS1 : Global Product Classification ",description:"GS1 Standards for Global Product Classification enable businesses to navigate the complexities of the international marketplace.

Instagram shops is the digital storefront for brands and businesses which helps them list their products using their own branding. Potential buyers will be shown products in the app which can then be purchased natively in the application itself without the need to visit the business' website. This allows the shopper to have a convenient, simple, and secure shopping experience on a single platform.

Once verified, you can set up a shop which can be managed in the Commerce Manager. The checkout process is enabled within the Instagram Shop itself. You can use your existing product catalog or a new one to target your shoppers on the app. If a user is interested in a product, they can easily complete the purchase on Instagram. The payment and shipping information for orders only needs to be entered once by the consumer and will be stored by Facebook. This way shoppers do not have to re-enter any of this information when making additional purchases. In addition, there is no requirement for creating a new account to complete transactions.\n\nInstagram checkout also complements other shopping tools available on Instagram. For example: shopping from creators when they tagged your products in their posts, notifying shoppers about upcoming product launches or live shopping. In all mentioned cases, buyers can just shop the product right away.\n\nAllowing your consumers to profit from this seamless shopping experience is a key part of a successful [P2C](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002F \"P2C\") strategy. \n\n\u003Ch3\u003EInstagram checkout: Setup and management\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\nTo set up the checkout function in the US market, you need the following information:\n- Business category and type\n- A business address in the US \n- US Bank account details for collecting payouts\n- A state tax registration number for every state in which the business operates\n- A federal tax identification number that matches the business representative’s name for financial reporting \n- A business representative’s personal or business identity information to verify the authenticity of the business \n- Delivery options, return policy, and a customer service email address to set up customer service\n\nCheckout on Instagram also requires you to be a Business Manager admin and the owner of your Instagram business account, Facebook page, and catalog in the Business Manager. In addition, you need to have Manage Page permissions for the Facebook Page connected to the Instagram business account and Manage catalog permissions for your product catalog. Last but not least, it’s necessary to have a commerce account which is connected to your Instagram business account, Facebook Page, and catalog.

The answer lies in understanding  retail channels and learning how they shape our shopping experiences.\n\n## What is a retail channel? \nA retail channel is the pathway through which products and services flow from businesses to consumers. It encompasses the various methods and locations where transactions occur, ranging from physical stores to online platforms and even hybrid approaches that blend both in-person and digital interactions. In this article, we'll explore the diverse retail channels that have transformed how we shop and do business.\n\n## Types of retail channels \n\nRetail channels have diversified significantly in recent years, offering consumers many  options to discover, purchase, and interact with products and services. Let's look deeper into the types of retail channels, examining their unique characteristics, examples, and their impact on the retail landscape:\n\n- Brick-and-mortar retail: The time-tested tradition\n\nBrick-and-mortar stores have been the bedrock of retail for centuries. Think of your neighborhood mom-and-pop shop or the grandeur of a luxury department store. They provide customers with tangible, hands-on experiences and face-to-face interactions with products and staff. The ability to physically interact with products, testing their features and attributes before committing to a purchase, continues to be a significant benefit. These stores vary in size and style, from neighborhood boutiques to expansive department stores.\n\nA shining example of this is Apple, whose sleek, minimalist retail stores have become iconic. In 2021, despite the rise of ecommerce, 85% of total retail sales in the United States were still generated through brick-and-mortar stores. They cater to consumers who prefer the in-person experience, immediate gratification and trust established through human interaction.\n\n- Ecommerce: The digital shopping revolution\n\nEcommerce, or online shopping, has become a dominant force in retail, reshaping how consumers make purchases. Prominent players like [Amazon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Famazon-marketplace\u002F), Alibaba, and eBay have set the standard for ecommerce platforms. Buyers have the convenience of browsing through a wide selection of products right from their own homes at any hour of the day. \nAs per [Statista](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.statista.com\u002Fstatistics\u002F379046\u002Fworldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales\u002F), global ecommerce sales will reach a staggering $8.1 trillion by 2026. The convenience of shopping from your couch, combined with vast product selections, is a key driver of this growth.\n\n- Omnichannel retail: The best of both worlds\n\n[Omnichannel](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.productsup.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fterm\u002Fomnichannel\u002F) retail is an innovative approach that seeks to bridge the gap between physical and digital retail experiences.

Let’s explore the emerging trends in this space.\n\n- Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)\n\nImagine trying on clothes virtually, seeing furniture in your living room before purchasing, or even experiencing a vacation destination in VR. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are transforming how we perceive and engage with online shopping, ushering in a new era of retail experience.\n\n- Social commerce\n\nSocial media platforms are becoming shopping hubs.

Consumers enjoy curated experiences and the element of surprise delivered right to their doorstep.\n\n- Voice commerce\n\nVoice-activated devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home are changing how we shop. By simply speaking, users can place orders, find products, and get recommendations.\n\n- Sustainability and eco-friendly retail\n\nA growing number of consumers are exhibiting heightened awareness regarding their impact on the environment. So, retailers are actively incorporating sustainable and eco-friendly product lines, emphasizing their dedication to the planet as a USP.\n\nAs we embrace these trends and harness the power of technology, it's essential to stay agile and innovative, ensuring that our shopping experiences are not only convenient but also fun.
